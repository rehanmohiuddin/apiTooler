## Tech

API Tooler uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Axios] - XML Http Request for Web!
- [Fetch] - WEB API from Browser
- [react-textarea-code-editor] - Text Editor For Entering Data & Showing Response
- [Tailwind CSS] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- [Webpack] - Best Bundler For My Web Apps
- [React] - Code Reusability

## How did you decide which technologies to use as part of your solution?

- React Which has composite nature, breaking component to smaller chunks so that one time focus on one feature and building incrementally & ofcourse react's virtual dom feature making focus on UI/UX code more than dom manipulation

- Fetch/Axios Uses XMLHttp request i.e make request to servers without page refresh

## Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?

- Generating Code By Selecting the Languague With respect to that API
- Adding Share Feature
- Adding Debugging Feature
- Add More support to other content types like XML
- Make UI More Sharp & Pixel Perfect
- Optimizations
- Add Form Data Support
- Other ready headers like Authorization

## What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?

- Add Form Data Support
- Make UI/UX User Friendly & Better
- Many Platform Provide API Testing I Would Focus More on API Debugging (That's where other platform's don't focus too much)
- Responsive So That API calls can be made through mobile too
